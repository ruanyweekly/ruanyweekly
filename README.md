## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Back in 2016, I was leading the building of web and
mobile apps so fast that some products went from
idea to store in just two months. Even on that speed,
some of these still running now a day.
Since then, I’ve worked across startups and global
teams, building everything from neobanking platforms
with GraphQL and TypeScript, to real-time social
systems with React Native and Node.
What I enjoy most is turning complex ideas into
products people actually use, and coordinating cross-
functional teams.

Today, I’m looking for a challenging position where I
can bring this mix of product thinking, and technical
depth to help build the next big thing.
